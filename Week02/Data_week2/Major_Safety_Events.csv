The signaling system perceived there to be a ghost train occupying the same track circuit, which caused the gates to clear, and the power anomaly failed to recognize the approaching train that collided with the motorist.

The {Redacted} ad {Redacted} were subsequently notified of the failure. Just prior to the collision, the signaling system detected a malfunction in its system, and removed the speed code from the incident train on three consecutive occasions. However, instead of notifying control and requesting authorization to change operating modes, the train operator took it upon himself to put the train back into service by placing the train in "" street - running "" mode, which is a violation of our safety rules. By doing this he bypassed "" stop and proceed "" mode, which is the safest mode of travel. Also, a post incident investigation revealed that all the components involved in the signaling power system, passed their integrity tests, including the back - up batteries.   However, as an additional safety precaution, both the charger and batteries were replaced in order to rule out any possibility of a similar occurrence. The weather was clear and dry.

 The moments leading up to the derailment, the {Redacted} {Redacted} was responsible for the movement of two hi - rails vehicles ( trains # {Redacted}, and # {Redacted} ) that were operating simultaneously on the {Redacted} and {Redacted} tracks, respectively. Hi - rail # {Redacted} was located near {Redacted} ( {Redacted} ) Interlocking and the incident hi - railtrain # {Redacted} was located near {Redacted} ( {Redacted} ) Interlocking. The controller routed hi - rail # {Redacted} from one west end of {Redacted} {Redacted} to the east end of the interlocking ( {Redacted} to {Redacted} ) with the understanding that once they cleared the far switch, they would notify the {Redacted} so the {Redacted} could line the switch for the hi - rail ’s intended route. While this was occurring, hi - rail # {Redacted} was also traversing {Redacted} interlocking ( {Redacted} to {Redacted} ) with the understanding that they would also notify the {Redacted} that they were clear of the interlocking. When hi - rail # {Redacted} notified control they were clear of {Redacted} {Redacted}, the {Redacted} confused # {Redacted} with # {Redacted}, and errantly threw the switch under hi - rail # {Redacted} causing it to derail. 

 The controller was re - trained for failing to identify the location of each train prior to throwing the switch. 

 Metro hi - rail vehicles are not equipped with video recording devices, thus, there was no video available for this event.

The switch was not lined for the intended route and as the car derailed through the switch point the middle, “ C ”, truck came off the rails. This section of track is located on a curve as well as then incident switch. As a result of the derailment the switch point indicator ( {Redacted} ) was damaged and the concrete ties suffered minor abrasions as a result of wheel contact. There were no injuries reported as a result of the slow - speed derailment. 

 The {Redacted} {Redacted} Yard is in pre - revenue service and as a result has a number of punch list items to complete before revenue operation. Due to signal work being conducted in the yard, many of the switches in the yard have been placed into the hand - throw position and fuses removed. These switches, including switch 21, are noted in the Yard {Redacted} {Redacted}. 

 Per the Operator ’s statement, the switch point indicator light was dark due to the switch being out of motor and in the hand - throw position. 

 Per the {Redacted} ’s report, during the time leading up to the derailment, the operator was instructed by the Yard {Redacted} to stop and read back all switch points before proceeding. The operator failed to read back the switch she derailed over. 

 The train operator was taken for a drug and alcohol test as per procedure. 

 Multiple attempts were made to retrieve the car ’s video system footage of the incident; however, it was discovered that this car was still undergoing acceptance testing and had not been officially accepted by Metro. As a result, the car did not have a functional video system and no video or audio from the car was captured.
