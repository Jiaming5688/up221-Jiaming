## DataSet 1
- Name: Major Safety Events
- Description: This dataset is from the U.S. Department of Transportation. It contains the details of major safety and security events from 2014 to 2023. The original dataset is over 250MB and cannot be uploaded to Github, so I only left the data for the Los Angeles area. In my project, this dataset can be used to evaluate traffic safety conditions.

## Dataset 2
